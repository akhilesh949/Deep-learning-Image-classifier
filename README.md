# Deep-learning-Image-classifier
This is an image classifier using a convolutional neural network(made using keras library) in which the dependent variable is binary, that is, can belong to one of two classes. When I wrote this code, I trained it on 10,000 images of cats and dogs(5,000 each) and the model was trained to learn the features of cats and dogs.
