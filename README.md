# Deep-learning-Image-classifier
This is an image classifier using a convolutional neural network(made using keras library) with one hidden layer and two convolutional layers. The dependent variable is binary, that is, can belong to one of two classes. When I wrote this code, I trained it on 10,000 images of cats and dogs(5,000 each) and the model was trained to learn the features of cats and dogs.
The rest of the informations can be found in the markdowns of the code.
